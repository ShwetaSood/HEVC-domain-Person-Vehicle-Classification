# HEVC-domain-Person-Vehicle-Classification
Segmentation and classification of person and vehicles in compressed videos (HEVC/ H.265)

In video analysis at large scales, such as content analysis and search for a large surveillance network, the complexity of video decoding becomes a major bottleneck of the real-time system.<br> 
To address this issue, explored compression-domain approaches for video content analysis which extracts features directly from the bit stream syntax, such as motion vectors and block coding modes. This implies low computational complexity since the full-scale decoding and reconstruction of pixels are avoided.

Exploiting features from compressed bitstream: motion vectors, prediction modes, coding unit depth to train SVM classifier for prediction. Feature extraction involved extensive debugging of open source HM software codec (reference implementation of the HEVC coding)<br><br>



More details to be added soon.
