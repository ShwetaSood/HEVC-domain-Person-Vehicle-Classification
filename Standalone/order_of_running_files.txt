The following files are to be run in the specified fashion
1. read_cupu.py
2. mv_interpolation.py
3. mv_filtering.py
4. mv_refining.py
5. small_mv_removal.py
6. four_connectivity_component_labeling.py
7. old_object_region_tracking.py (can be compared with object_region_tracking.py but before running this file run 'forward_projection.py')
8. object_boundary_refinement.py
9. features.py
10. kmeans.py
11. training_and testing.py
12. accuracy.py

Helper files:
1. read_cupu_org.py - reads decoder files but doesn't generate spatial 4x4 mapping
2. read_spatial.py - helps in writing output images of any step
3. comparison_images.py - helps in comparing any two output files

Optional files to be run:
1. object_region_tracking.py - was corrected version but didn't help much for highway, can see for other videos. 
	Corrections were:
	a. The range was change from t-3 to t+3 to t-4 to t+4
	b. The projection formula was changed to accommodate negative motion vector. Taking sign of vector separately
	c. Forward projection to do t to t+4, was done such that motion  vectors store information of forward frames using forward_projection.py
	d. assertion to check projection>=0 and projection< height/width

2. forward_projection.py - used to calculate forward projection of a frame (t to t+4). By storing motion vectors of t+1 (which are wrt to t) in t frame, so on and so forth.
Note: Motion vectors for a frame are originally, displacement of a reference frame wrt to current frame.
